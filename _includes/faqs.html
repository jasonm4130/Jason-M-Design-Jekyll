This is for both of our benifits. You paying a depoisit helps us as we know that you aren't going to run off on us once we hand over the work. Paying a deposit also helps you, once you have paid your deposit. You are a paying client and as such you get extra special treatment!</div></div></div><!-- Accordion item end--><!-- Accordion item start--><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title font-alt"><a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#sales3">Do you have Terms and Conditions?</a></h4></div><div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="sales3"><div class="panel-body">Yes of course we do, before starting any project we send you a contract, which you agree to and then send back.

This is ultimately a less enjoyable experience. Responsive design, like the kind we employ in all of our website is different. It allows users to view the same page, but in a way that works great for the mobile devices.</div></div></div><!-- Accordion item end--><!-- Accordion item start--><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title font-alt"><a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion3" href="#notice2">Can you help with my existing site?</a></h4></div><div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="notice2"><div class="panel-body">Of course, we understand that not every situation calls for a completely new website.
