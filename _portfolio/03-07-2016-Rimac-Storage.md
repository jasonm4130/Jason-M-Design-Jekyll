Rimac Storage Systems, was a new design for a website that had aged. Their old website although it still had a modern feel wasn't up to the standards that were expected. Their old website was also missing the hugely important responsive design that is standard for all modern website.

As such these were two main focuses in the re-design of this website. Overall the project was completed successfully with a great outcome for the business. A new website with a refreshed look, able to better represent them to their potential clients.
