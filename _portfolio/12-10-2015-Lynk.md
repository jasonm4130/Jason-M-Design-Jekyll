Lynk was designed as a mobile app and corresponding web page. The concept behind Lynk was to promote blood donation through resolving many of the reasons people don't donate currently.

Extensive market research was conducted prior to the initial conceptualizing of the app and the design. The design was decided as it allowed the app to connect with the younger generation and present blood donation as an important action saving lives.

Although lynk was never created as an app or continued past the design process we are extremely happy with the visual design elements we created with this concept.
