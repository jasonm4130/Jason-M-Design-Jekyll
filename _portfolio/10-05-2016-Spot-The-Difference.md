The Website designed for the Spot the Difference Campaign was a huge success. Allowing the client to sell all their stock within days of launching. This in turn enabled them to raise much needed funds for Skin Cancer charities.

With the site needing to be developed in a rapid fashion with only a few days between initial contact and launch, this contributed greatly to the success of the site.

Overall the spot the difference shirts website allowed Ariel to achieve part of her goals to accomplish a greater awareness for skin cancer and funds to help with this. This in turn saw her become Miss World New Zealand Tourism International with opportunities to continue to positively impact many lives.
