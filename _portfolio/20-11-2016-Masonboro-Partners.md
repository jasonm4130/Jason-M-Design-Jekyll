Masonboro Partners had an existing site with some major security concerns and display problems. Initially we helped them to resolve these security concerns and restore their site to the way it originally was.

Throughout time however the project evolved to become much more than fixing some errors on the site. We created a completely custom theme for Masonboro Partners, this allowed for much better load times and a more professional look, compared to their old generic template.

After completion of the project we have remained in touch with Masonboro Partners and continue to provide maintenance and support for their website whenever they need it.
