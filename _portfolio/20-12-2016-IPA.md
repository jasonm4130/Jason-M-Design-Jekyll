Institute of Pacific Australia's website needed a new look. Their old site was semi outdated and becoming too difficult to navigate and maintain with the new content that they have added.

Through a great discovery process we were able to establish goals for the re-design. Ultimately these goals came down to two things. They wanted their website to look great, and connect with potential students. On top of this they also wanted their site to be easier to manage rather than old clunky way that they had to edit content. To top these two major goals off their site was slow to load and we wanted to make their new site load fast.

This project is still ongoing although check in for more updates soon.
